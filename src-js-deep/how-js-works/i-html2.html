         These methods for HTML element selection are dependent on the DOM already having loaded


         Since HTML loads from top to bottom, the location of our JavaScript actually matters. 
         If we put JavaScript at the end of our HTML document, as we have done here, 
         
         then the DOM will have already loaded by the time the script runs.


          If the DOM is loaded, we can use methods like document.querySelector() without any concerns. 

          In these scenarios, you need to tell JavaScript to wait for the DOM to load.

          To do that, we need to add what is known as an “event listener,” which listens 
          for specific events, to the HTML DOM (or document object) itself. 
          This event listener will “fire” whenever the DOM is loaded, 
          meaning you can only use methods like document.querySelector()
          within the event listener body:

         */
        document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", (e) => {
            window.alert('DOMContentLoaded');
        })
    </script>
</head>

<body>
    <p>Hello World</p>
</body>

<script type="text/javascript">
    /*
     * Sometimes, you won’t have a choice on where your JavaScript goes,
     *  but if you do, putting your JavaScript at the end of your HTML 
     * document is usually easier. 
     * 
     * Not only can you skip the event 
     * listener function, but it means your JavaScript will load last, 
     * allowing all your other content to load first. That means faster 
     * load times for your user,
     *  who can access your page before your JavaScript has been fetched.
     *
