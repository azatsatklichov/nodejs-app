/**
 * Block-less Statements
An if or while or do or for statement can take a block or a single statement. The single
statement form is another attractive nuisance. It offers the advantage of saving
two characters, a dubious advantage. It obscures the programâ€™s structure so that subsequent
manipulators of the code can easily insert bugs.

Programs that appear to do one thing but actually do another are much harder to get
right. A disciplined and consistent use of blocks makes it easier to get it right.

//can become:
if (ok)
    t = true;
    advance();

//which looks like:
if (ok) {
    t = true;
    advance();
}


//but which actually means:
if (ok) {
    t = true;
}
advance();
