<h2>JavaScript String Methods</h2>

<p>ECMAScript 5 allows property acces on strings. but read only:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<pre>
Property access might be a little unpredictable:

It does not work in Internet Explorer 7 or earlier
It makes strings look like arrays (but they are not)
If no character is found, [ ] returns undefined, while charAt() returns an empty string.
It is read only. str[0] = "A" gives no error (but does not work!)
</pre>

<script>
    var str = "HELLO WORLD";
    str[0] = "A";  // Does not work
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = str[0];
</script>
</body>
</html>
