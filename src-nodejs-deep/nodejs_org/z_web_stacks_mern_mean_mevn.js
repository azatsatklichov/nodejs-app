 * What are web stacks?

Firstly let us understand what is a stack, if you are familiar 
with web development or full-stack development you might have come 
across the terms MEAN, MERN, LAMP, etc. These are web application 
stacks consisting of a bundle of software and frameworks used for 
building a web application from front-end to back-end and make them 
fully functional. A stack usually consists of database software, 
back-end or front-end technology, a particular Operating 
system(Sometimes back-end technologies are cross-platform 
    hence no particular OS), a web-server.
